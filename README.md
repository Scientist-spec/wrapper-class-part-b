Student Object Serialization and Deserialization
A Java program that demonstrates object serialization and deserialization using a Student class. This program shows how to persist object state to a file and retrieve it later.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project implements Java's serialization mechanism to:

Create Student objects with ID, name, and grade

Serialize (save) the object to a binary file

Deserialize (load) the object from the file

Verify data integrity after deserialization
